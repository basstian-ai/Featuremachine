Featuremachine Vision
Featuremachine is a self-improving demo application that shows how an AI Dev Agent can continuously build and evolve real software.
Starting as a simple feature voting board, it grows incrementally – new features, bug fixes, and improvements are added in tiny, safe steps.
Core principles:
Always deployable: every commit builds, tests, and deploys successfully.
Agent-driven iteration: tasks and roadmap items guide the AI Dev Agent to propose PRs.
Minimal diffs: each change is small, focused, and reviewable.
Composable tech: built with Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel for a modern, low-friction stack.
Long term, Featuremachine demonstrates how AI teammates can handle routine development while humans steer vision and strategy – making software that is continuously evolving, stable, and aligned with goals
